  "product_name": "Full product name as shown on packaging",
  "brand": "Brand name",
  "product_type": "e.g. Moisturiser, Serum, Cleanser, SPF, Toner, Eye Cream, etc.",
  "confidence": "high | medium | low — how confident you are in the identification",
  "description": "1–2 sentence plain-English summary of what this product does",
  "key_ingredients": [
    {
      "name": "Ingredient name",
      "benefit": "What it does for the skin",
      "concern_level": "none | low | medium | high",
      "concern_reason": "Why it may be a concern, or null if none"
    }
  ],
  "features": [
    "e.g. Fragrance-free", "Vegan", "SPF 50", "Non-comedogenic", "Cruelty-free"
  ],
  "skin_types": {
    "recommended": ["e.g. Dry", "Normal", "Combination"],
    "avoid": ["e.g. Oily", "Acne-prone"]
  },
  "how_to_use": "Brief usage instructions if visible or known",
  "similar_products": [

      "reason": "Why it is a good alternative"
    }
  ],
  "warnings": [
    "Any notable allergens, interactions, or usage warnings — omit array if none"
  ]
}

Rules:
- If you cannot identify the product clearly, still return the schema with your best assessment and set confidence to "low".
- List at least 3 key_ingredients and 3 similar_products.
- similar_products must be real, commercially available products.
- Return ONLY the JSON object. No other text.
